      If you want career advice, I do not believe I am qualified or experienced
      enough to give anyone advice. My suggestion would be to find someone who
      has proven themselves in the industry and have been working since a few
      years. That said, you can reach out to me on my socials. But emailing
      would be the fastest way. Email me at{' '}

      I got into web development during the COVID-19 lockdown. I needed
      something to do and my friend suggested programming. I learnt the basics

      <p>Yes and No.</p>

      <p>
        Yes, some people judge that I am not as good as someone who has done
        B.Tech in CS. And that is true. He/she got a chance to study the
        fundamentals during the building years of his/her life in a very
        systematic order.
      </p>

      <p>
        No, if you truly enjoy doing something, you would find a way to do it
        regardless of how many obstacles come your way. Being from a different
        field just gives us the opportunity to learn more & expand our knowledge
      </p>

      <p>
        PS - On that note, yes, I have to put extra efforts to keep at par
        because I am not aware of many terms that are used in the daily
        conversations.
